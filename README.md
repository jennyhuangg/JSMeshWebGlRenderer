#JSMeshWebGLRenderer
Computer Graphics HW6

For this assignment, you will build a projection renderer in WebGL.

Part 1: Display a simple 2-D shape.
Part 2: Display a 3-D shape with orthographic/parallel projection.
Part 3: Display multiple shapes, using instance transforms.
Part 4: Display multiple shapes in perspective.
Part 5: Display a whole scene of your choice in perspective.

Do each of these parts. In each part you will create a single matching HTML/JS file pair. Each part involves two steps: a simple beginning and then an “upgrade” to more sophisticated functionality or structure.
